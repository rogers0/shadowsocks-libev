Description: lightweight and secure socks5 proxy (development files)
 Shadowsocks-libev is a lightweight and secure socks5 proxy for
 embedded devices and low end boxes.
 .
 Shadowsocks-libev was inspired by Shadowsock (in Python). It's rewritten
 in pure C and only depends on libev, mbedTLS and a few other tiny
 libraries. OpenSSL dependency is removed due to license issue.
 .
 This package provides C header files for the libraries.
