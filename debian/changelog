  * debian/control
    - Move to git repo to collab-maint on alioth

    Install config.json file to /usr/share/<pkg>, instead of /etc, and then
    generate a config file under /etc, because conffile (under /etc) cannot
    be modified by maintainer script according to Debian Policy.
    Thanks help from Andreas Beckmann. (Closes: #829478)
